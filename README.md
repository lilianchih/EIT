Plot the transmission and phase shift of probe beam.

EIT(electromagnetically induced transparency) is achieved in a three-level system (|g1>, |g2>, |e> )when the coupling laser(|e><g2|) and the probe laser(|e><g1|) have the same detuning.

Vary the parameters and observe the effects. Note that when delta_p = delta_c, there is a peak in transmission.
